This is the developer's brainstorming stribbles.

Part roguelite, part interactive fiction, & part text adventure, 
along with elements of RPG.

Save, load, and create json files.

It begins with character statistic customization.

All the dungeon maps are generated through random roguelite dungeon 
generation algorithm.

Character types: 
* based on Person object 
** Player (customizable) 
** Allies (shares player's attributes, but AI controlled) 
** NPC (only appears in town levels) 
* based on Opponent object 
** guards (normally sees in dungeons) 
** bosses (much stronger than normal guards)
