It begins with character creation. But DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT WITH IT.

Character creation - but what if it turns out it was for the villain?

All the dungeon maps are generated through random roguelite dungeon
generation algorithm.

Character types:
* based on Person object
** Player (customizable)
** Allies (shares player's attributes, but AI controlled)
** NPC (only appears in town levels)
* based on Opponent object 
** guards (normally sees in dungeons)
** bosses (much stronger than normal guards)
